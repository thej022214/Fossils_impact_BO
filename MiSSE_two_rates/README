The following provides an explanation of each "scenario":

Scenario1 = regime B (t_B=0.50) had a turnover rate that was 2x the rate of regime A (t_A=0.25); 
	extinction fraction was set at 0.75 for both regimes.

Scenario2 = regime B (t_B=0.50) had a turnover rate that was 2x the rate of regime A (t_A=0.25);
	regime A had a lower extinction fraction (e_A=0.55) than regime B (e_B=0.75)

Scenario3 = regime A and B had identical turnover rates (t_A=t_B=0.375) and extinction fractions 
	(e_A=e_B=0.75)

Scenario4 = This is the scenario described in detail in section "How Do Fossils Help in a World Where 
	All Models are Simply Wrong?" found in the main text.
