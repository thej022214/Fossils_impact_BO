Yes I know that my file naming isn't ideal. But here is a legend to understand what each "test" prefix means:

test1_5000points010  =  Extant only surface
test2_5000points010  =  Full fossil surface for generating psi of 0.01
test3_5000points010  =  k fossils removed from test2 for generating psi of 0.01
test4_5000points010  =  Full fossil set converted to stratigraphic ranges for generating psi of 0.01
test2_5000points100  =  Full fossil surface for generating psi 0f 0.10
test3_5000points100  =  k fossils removed from test4 for generating psi of 0.10
test4_5000points100  =  Full fossil set converted to stratigraphic ranges for generating psi of 0.10
test5_5000points100  =  Full fossil set converted to stratigraphic ranges for generating psi of 0.10, 
			but where surface is based on net diversification and extinction fraction.
